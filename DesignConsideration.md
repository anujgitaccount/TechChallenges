# TODO:
A 3-tier environment is a common setup. Use a tool of your choosing/familiarity create these resources on a cloud environment (Azure/AWS/GCP). Please remember we will not be judged on the outcome but more focusing on the approach, style and reproducibility.

# Design Consideration:
To setup a standard 3 tier environment architecture, we need an Application front end which can be a VM running IIS, a Business Logic Layer which can be a windows or linux server and a Data Access Layer which can ve created on any RDMS offering. In this implementation.

Our Architecture Should adhere the AWS Well Architected Framework-
* Security
* Releiability
* Operational Excellence
* Performance Efficiency
* Cost optimization
* Sustainability

By using above key pillars we can develop strong architecture which would provide High Avalability, Scalability and many more benefits.

Below components can also be used to fullfil the actaul requirements-

FrontEndLoad Balancer ---> Front End VMs ---> Back End Load Balancer ---> Back End VMs ---> DataBase Firewall ---> Database

# Approach:
Designed this project on AWS as my expertise lies in the AWS cloud. I am open to explore Google Cloud and Azure as needed for the role in the future.

Here I am going to explain how a 3 tier architecture can be designed which can have FrontEnd(Client), Backend(Service) and Database part.
below is the diagram which explains how to create EC2 intance.

* We need to generate cft in yml/json which is used to create EC2, that can later be associated with Application Load balancer.
* We can create Internet-facinf load balancer , please ensure if you are going to create Internet facing ALB then your must use public subnet.
* The Listner should be propely configured to redirect the http/https request to the origin server.
* The best practice is that our ec2 instances(if we are using multiple instance)should be kept in multiple Availability zones to achieive the Fault-Tolerance and High Availability.
* We can user Route 53 dns service to redirect to resolve the dns into correspodning IPs and can be redirected to desired ALB. Means, when user hits any web urls like www.kpmg.com then it wil go to Route 53 where we have the records set already created (one is primary record and other is secondary record which is for redirecting the request to gone fishing page in case of failover) which is resolve the dns ip into ALB's IP then after it's ALB which can redirect the request to appropriate healthy servers.
* We can also use Serverless Service like AWS lambda in place of EC2 instance, it depends on the requirements.
* We can enable the autoscalling on ec2 instances. it can be either vertical or horizontal depending on the requirement. but in most of the cases we use Horizontal scalling as we know there Should not be ' # single point of failure'.
* To enable Autoscalling , we have to have ASG which contains Configuration and template, we first need to use 'launch template' feature given on AWS, then we can use this template which working on ' launch configuration' once it is done then we setup the autoscalling. it has some features like ' desired capacity' min capacity and maximum capacity.
* if we are using microservices architecture where we need to set up the resource, we can user the combination of API Gateway,AWS Lambda(to deploy microservices) Custom Domain name feature to replace the default api urls generated by API gateway, Route53, etc...
* Instead of using AWS lambda we can use Docker container to create the image and we can use the ECS to orchestrate them which can use EC2 Machines or Fargate.
* The best time to choose AWS Lambda is when we are working on Batch Jobs or schedulars else we should use VMs.
* Now, coming again to VPC and other stuffs, we can use IGW to allow our public subnet to communicate over internet.
* A Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway is a device is used to enable EC2 instances kept under private subnet to connect to the Internet and prevent the Internet to make a connection with those instances inside private subnet.
